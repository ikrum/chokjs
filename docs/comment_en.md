#Comments 
When you are writing code you may be writing a complex algorithm that after a while you may see the code of aliens. When it comes to building a large system, you will not remember what you wrote or why you wrote it, and it is normal not to. Moreover, if someone reads your code line by line and wants to understand the system, it will not be easy to understand. To solve this problem, it is better to write some comments along with the code. The comment is not actually a code, "write something in the code in your own way for the convenience of understanding the code". Single line and multi-line comments are shown below.
```
